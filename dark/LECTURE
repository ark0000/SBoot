In Spring boot
beans are objects that managed by IOC container that is application context amage life cycle of beans
 application context is object that has these beans
@SpringbootApplication is an alias for 3 annotations
@Configuration

tell class can be used by SPRING IOC CONTAINER aS the source for creating beans can be used

@EnableAutoConfiguration
It automatically config the application based on classpath that the dependencies or defaults it mentione.This reduces boilerplate code for common configurations.
@Componentscan
it tells to specify the base package(s) to scan for Spring components
lOok for controller,configurations,rep,services for beans  dependency injections
not only but  @Component, @Controller, @Service, @Repository etc
@Component
tells that class is component which  can be created as objects that is beans
dependency injjection
it  means the objects registered in IOCcontatiner specified by  @Configuration injected
using fields constructors method in other components,repo,services

IOC
It means instead of creating a object manually the object creted by container
Beans or created in IOC using xml or annotations
Autoconfiguration: As you mentioned, Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the classpath. This reduces boilerplate code for common configurations.
Spring Profiles: Allows you to configure different environments (e.g., development, test, production) with different bean definitions and properties.
Spring Actuator: Provides endpoints for monitoring and health checks of your application.
Spring Data: Simplifies data access with integrations for various databases (e.g., JPA, MongoDB).
Spring Security: Enables authentication and authorization for your application

Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): Allows you to intercept method calls and add cross-cutting concerns like logging or security.
Spring AOP allows you to define cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, security, and transaction management separately from your core application logic. This separation offers several benefits:

Improved Maintainability: Code for cross-cutting concerns is centralized and reusable across different parts of your application.
Reduced Code Duplication: No need to repeat logging, caching, or security checks in every method.
Modular Design: Concerns are encapsulated, promoting cleaner and more modular code.
Aspects: You define classes annotated with @Aspect to encapsulate cross-cutting logic. These aspects contain advice (the actual code to execute) and pointcuts (where to apply the advice).
Advice: This is the code that gets executed at specific points in the application flow. Spring provides different types of advice, such as @Before, @After, @Around, etc., for execution at different points (before, after, around a method call).
Pointcuts: Annotations like @Pointcut define expressions that match methods or execution points where the advice should be applied. Pointcuts can be based on method signatures, annotations on methods or classes, or other criteria.
Weaving: At runtime, Spring "weaves" the advice from aspects into your application code. This weaving can be done through bytecode manipulation or class weaving techniques.
Benefits of Usin


Messaging: Spring provides support for message-based communication between applications (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
Cloud Integration: Spring Cloud offers libraries for deploying applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure.
